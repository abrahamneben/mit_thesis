This thesis presents new instrumentation and analysis techniques for observations of redshifted 21\,cm and Lyman-$\alpha$, and H-$\alpha$  emission from the Epoch of Reionization (EOR), as well as early science results from their application to real data. We develop a nearly all-sky, high dynamic range antenna measurement system and use it to characterize prototype antenna elements for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). We measure the model deviations at large zenith angles where the beam response crucially sets the amount of foreground power with high fringe rate. We then characterize the antenna-to-antenna variation over the MWA with laboratory measurement, and show that neglecting this effect results in severe foreground mis-subtraction in the wedge.

We then build on the optimal quadratic power spectrum analysis of Liu \& Tegmark and Dillon, Liu, \& Tegmark by estimating the covariance from the data itself in a suitably constrained way. We apply this method to 3\,hours of MWA data and set a limit on the 21\,cm EOR power spectrum of $\Delta(k) < 192$\,mK (95\%) at comoving scale $k = 0.18$\,$h$\,Mpc$^{-1}$ and $z = 6.8$, consistent with limits from other experiments. Then, to extend the scientific return of future 21\,cm detections, we perform a foreground and sensitivity analysis for 21\,cm--Ly$\alpha$ and 21\,cm--H$\alpha$ cross correlation experiments. Using data from the MWA, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) we show that geometric effects produce percent-level flux correlations between radio and near-infrared foregrounds. We use the optimal quadratic estimator to set a first limit of $\Delta_{21,\text{Ly}\alpha}<181\,(\text{kJy/sr}\cdot \text{mK})$ (95\%) at $\ell=400$ on the broad band angular 21\,cm--Ly-$\alpha$ cross spectrum at $z\sim7$. We show that higher resolution radio and near-infrared surveys such as LOFAR, SKA-LOW, Hubble, Dark Energy Survey can start to probe optimistic models of the 21\,cm--Ly$\alpha$ EOR cross spectrum.
