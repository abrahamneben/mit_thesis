%This thesis presents new instrumentation and analysis techniques for observations of redshifted 21\,cm, Lyman-$\alpha$, and H-$\alpha$  emission from the Epoch of Reionization (EOR), as well as early science results from their application to real data. We develop an all-sky, high dynamic range antenna measurement system and use it to characterize prototype antenna elements for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). We measure the model deviations at large zenith angles where the beam response crucially sets the amount of foreground power with high apparent frequency dependence in interferometer observations. We characterize the antenna-to-antenna variation over the MWA with lab measurements, and show that neglecting this effect results in severe foreground mis-subtraction.

%We build on the optimal quadratic power spectrum analysis of Liu \& Tegmark and Dillon, Liu, \& Tegmark by estimating the covariance from the data itself in a suitably constrained way. We apply this method to 3\,hours of MWA data and set a limit on the 21\,cm EOR power spectrum of $\Delta(k) < 192$\,mK (95\%) at comoving scale $k = 0.18$\,$h$\,Mpc$^{-1}$ and $z = 6.8$, consistent with limits from other experiments. To extend the scientific return of future 21\,cm detections, we perform a foreground and sensitivity analysis for 2D (i.e., broad band) 21\,cm--Ly$\alpha$ and 21\,cm--H$\alpha$ cross correlation experiments. Using data from the MWA, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) we find percent-level flux correlations between radio and near-infrared foregrounds, consistent with geometric effects. We use the optimal quadratic estimator to set a first limit of $\Delta^2<181\,(\text{kJy/sr}\cdot \text{mK})$ (95\%) at $\ell=800$ on the broad band angular 21\,cm--Ly-$\alpha$ cross spectrum at $z\sim7$. We show that in the near term, higher resolution radio and near-infrared surveys such as LOFAR, Hubble, Dark Energy Survey can start to probe optimistic models of the 2D 21\,cm--Ly$\alpha$ EOR cross spectrum. 

In the first part of this thesis, we present advances in antenna characterization for low frequency radio observations of 21\,cm emission from the Epoch of Reionization (EOR). Using satellite transmissions as probe signals, we map the all-sky, high dynamic range antenna response of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). We study deviations from numerical electromagnetic models and variation among the 128 MWA antenna elements, and show both effects severely limit foreground subtraction in the region of Fourier space where the EOR signal is brightest. We show that this contamination can be mitigated by modeling the observed foreground leakage as frequency covariance, then downweighting it using the optimal quadratic estimator of Liu \& Tegmark and Dillon, Liu, \& Tegmark.

In the second part of this thesis, we assess the real world prospects of cross-correlation measurements between 21\,cm, Lyman-$\alpha$, and H-$\alpha$ emission from the EOR. We show that geometric effects produce percent-level correlations between low frequency radio fluxes and near-infrared fluxes, and we set the first limit on the angular cross spectrum between 21\,cm and Lyman-$\alpha$ emission from the EOR. We show that in the near term, higher resolution radio and near-infrared surveys such as LOFAR and the Dark Energy Survey can start to probe optimistic models of the EOR.
