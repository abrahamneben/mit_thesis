<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You are responsible for
scheduling the thesis defense and arranging for the room in which it will take
place; the various research areas each have rooms that their students generally
use for defenses.&nbsp; START EARLY to arrange scheduling:&nbsp; it’s often
said that one of the hardest parts of the PhD program is getting all three
faculty members on your committee into the same room at the same time!&nbsp;
Once you have the date, time, and place established, please let Sydney Miller (<a
href="mailto:sydney@mit.edu)">sydney@mit.edu)</a> know the specifics, and
confirm your final thesis title with her as well.&nbsp; [Sydney is serving as
temporary Graduate Assistant in the wake of Sabrina Salvati’s
resignation.&nbsp; We’ll be hiring a new permanent staff member soon.]&nbsp;
Sydney will send notice to the Physics community, including to all faculty
members, as your defense is open to the public.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When should your defense
be?&nbsp; You’ll find that the Registrar’s official Academic Calendar lists
dates by which your thesis must be submitted, but these are official dates, and
in practice we have some discretion to accept your thesis later than the
Registrar’s date.&nbsp; For June graduates, Friday, May 5 is this year’s
official deadline.&nbsp; However, unofficially we can accept your finished
thesis two to three weeks later than this date, by individual arrangement
between you and us.&nbsp; The absolute final day we can accept your thesis is
Friday, May 26, 2017.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But that’s your finished
thesis, meaning that you are giving us a formally printed copy, on
library-specified paper and covers, signed by you and your advisor.&nbsp; First
you will need to submit a draft to your committee, who should let you know how
soon before the defense they want to see it &#8211; generally this is about two
weeks.&nbsp; You also need to consider that it’s likely you will have revisions
your committee requires you to make to the written thesis following your
defense.&nbsp; We recommend that you give yourself at least two weeks between
the day of your defense and the day you intend to turn the thesis in.&nbsp; So,
from the time you finish your draft for the committee to the time you submit
the final version to the Academic Programs Office, try to budget a full four
weeks.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the day you turn in your
thesis, we are required to report to the Physics Fiscal Office that you have
completed all the work for your PhD, and your graduate appointment will then be
cancelled at one of two points in the month:&nbsp; on the 15<sup>th</sup>, if
you have turned your thesis in between the first and fifteenth of the month, or
on the final day of the month, if you have turned it in between the sixteenth
and the last day of the month.&nbsp; If you are finishing close to the end of
the term, we will trust that you are taking the time you need to finish your
revisions, and will only insist on your turning in the final version as the
deadline approaches.&nbsp; If your schedule is such that you will defend and
finish your revisions any more than four weeks before the end of the term, we
will expect to receive it within two to three weeks after your defense.</span></p>
